      <h2 class="tribute-title">Career</h2>
      <p class="tribute-content">
      Frédéric François Chopin (1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849) was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era who wrote primarily for solo piano. He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose "poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation."</p>
      <p class="tribute-content"> 
      Chopin was born in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland. He completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20. At 21, he settled in Paris, and supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. In 1835, Chopin obtained French citizenship.</p>
      <p class="tribute-content">
      He maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin (known by her pen name, George Sand). A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of tuberculosis.</p>
      
      <h2 class="tribute-title">Composition</h2>
      <p class="tribute-content">
        All of Chopin's compositions include the piano, and most are for solo piano. His piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument: his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. His major piano works include:</p>

          <li class="genre">Mazurkas</li>
          <li class="genre">Waltzes</li>

          <li class="genre">Sonatas</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="tribute-content">
      Two important collections are the Études, Opp. 10 and 25 (which are a staple of that genre for pianists), and the 24 Preludes, Op. 28 (a cycle of short pieces paired in a major key/relative minor key pattern following the circle of fifths in clockwise steps).</p>
      <p class="tribute-content">
      Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart, and Schubert, and the atmosphere of the Paris salons of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, harmony, and musical form, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.</p>
